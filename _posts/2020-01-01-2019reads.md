## The War on Normal People by Andrew Yang

Andrew Yang's book ["The War on Normal People"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_on_Normal_People) is one of the most important books I read in 2019. The thought provoking look at Universal Basic Income and our ability to eliminate poverty as we enter the Fourth Industrial Revolution removed my apathy for politics.  

The War on Normal People is also available in audiobook format as read by the Chief himself on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PCbITvaRgg&list=PLxSX6ZK-E_wXGluo48dGxKN0ZvQi2qWS1&index=2&t=0s)

## Daemon by Daniel Suarez

Anyone involved in tech should read this book. The squillionaire founder of the largest game company in the world is dead, and unleashed a destructive daemon to destroy society. Whats not to love? 

## Freedom by Daniel Suarez

This is the second part of the Daemon series and possibly my single favorite book. The AR environment that is built in this world seems achievable in our lifetimes which makes me want to contribute to the technology. It also offers a fitting conclusion to the series. 

## Kill Decision by Daniel Suarez

After reading the Daemon series, I was hungry for more of Daniel Suarez content. Kill Decision is a pretty cool sci-fi story about drones following programmed in the patterns of killer ants. 

## Zero Day by Mark Russinovich

Mark Russinovich has such an interesting background and this book had such high reviews, I was actually a little let down by this one. That being said, I have the urge to read the next book in the "Jeff Aiken" series, so maybe I did like it? 

## Business Model Generation from Strategyzer

A former boss gave me this book knowing I would love it and they nailed it. A must have for anyone looking to build a business or get a better understanding of the business model canvas.

## The Hardcore Diaries by Mick Foley

Hard to go wrong with a Mick Foley memoir. This ones digs into his TNA run which is was enlightening. 

## The Lean Startup by Eric Reis

This book offers a ton of great insight into starting a business, while not being overwhelming. I had no idea it was from one of the founders of IMVU when I picked it up which was a nice surprise.
