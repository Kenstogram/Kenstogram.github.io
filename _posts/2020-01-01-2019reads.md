## The War on Normal People by Andrew Yang

Andrew Yang's book ["The War on Normal People"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_on_Normal_People) is one of the most important books I read in 2019. The thought provoking look at Universal Basic Income and our ability to eliminate poverty as we enter the Fourth Industrial Revolution removed my apathy for politics.  

The War on Normal People is also available in audiobook format as read by the Chief himself on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PCbITvaRgg&list=PLxSX6ZK-E_wXGluo48dGxKN0ZvQi2qWS1&index=2&t=0s)
