## The Lean Startup by Eric Reis

This book offers a ton of great insight into starting a business, while not being overwhelming. I had no idea it was from one of the founders of IMVU when I picked it up which was a nice surprise.

## Freedom by Daniel Suarez

This is the second part of the Daemon series and possibly my single favorite book. The AR environment that is built in this world seems achievable in our lifetimes which makes me want to contribute to the technology. It also offers a fitting conclusion to the series. 

## Kill Decision by Daniel Suarez

After reading the Daemon series, I was hungry for more of Daniel Suarez content. Kill Decision is a pretty cool sci-fi story about drones programmed in the patterns of killer ants. 

## Zero Day by Mark Russinovich

Mark Russinovich has such an interesting background and this book had such high reviews, I was actually a little let down by this one. That being said, I have the urge to read the next book in the "Jeff Aiken" series, so maybe I did like it? 

## The Hardcore Diaries by Mick Foley

Hard to go wrong with a Mick Foley memoir. This ones digs into his TNA run which is was enlightening.
