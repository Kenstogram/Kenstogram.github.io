## Have a Nice Day by Mick Foley

This is the best book in Pro Wrestling hands down and Mick Foley's first. Story goes the whole book was written on spiral notebooks which Mick carried around writing for years. Its hilarious and goes from his parents backyard in upstate New York to the top of a 16' HELL IN A CELL! Bah Gawd he's dead! What a story.

## The Martian by Andy Wier

Pretty cool book about a witty, resourceful engineer/astronaut stuck on Mars. The book is definitely better than the movie, but both are worth the time for anyone looking for a space mishap action comedy.

## Your Ideas, Inc by Sandy Abrams

A book about starting a business from the creator of Moisture Jamzz! I'd recommend many others above this one, but its a nice look at a sustainable business model.
