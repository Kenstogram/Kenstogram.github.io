## The Best in the World: At What I Have No Idea by Chris Jericho

Chris Jericho, Pro Wrestler and lead singer of Fozzy is at it again. From his mega heel championship run in 2008 to a surprise babyface entrance into the Royal Rumble in 2013, we get a backstage pass through it all. Chris shares stories of international tours in WWE, as a rock and roll star with Fozzy, epic drinking nights with John Cena, and in Hollywood with Dancing with the Stars. The constant that I find in all of his books is Chris is always one of the most hardworking people in the room and always willing to stay out all night afterwards.
