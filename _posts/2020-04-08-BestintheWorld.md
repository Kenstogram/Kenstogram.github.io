title: The Best in the World at What I Have No Idea by Chris Jericho
---

Chris Jericho, Pro Wrestler and lead singer of Fozzy is at it again. From his mega heel championship run in 2008 to a surprise babyface entrance into the Royal Rumble in 2013, we get a backstage pass through it all. Chris shares stories of international tours in WWE, opening up for Metallica, epic drinking nights with John Cena, and in Hollywood with Dancing with the Stars. The constant that I find in all of his books is Chris is always one of the most hardworking people in the room and always willing to stay out all night afterwards.
