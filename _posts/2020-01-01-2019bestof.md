## The War on Normal People by Andrew Yang

Andrew Yang's ["The War on Normal People"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_on_Normal_People) is probably the most important book I read in 2019. The thought provoking look at Universal Basic Income and our ability to eliminate poverty as we enter the Fourth Industrial Revolution removed my apathy for politics.  

The War on Normal People is also available in audiobook format as read by the Chief himself on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PCbITvaRgg&list=PLxSX6ZK-E_wXGluo48dGxKN0ZvQi2qWS1&index=2&t=0s)

## Daemon by Daniel Suarez

Anyone involved in tech should read this book. The squillionaire founder of the largest game company in the world is dead, and unleashed a destructive daemon to destroy society. Whats not to love? 

## Business Model Generation from Strategyzer

A former boss gave me this book knowing I would love it and they nailed it. A must have for anyone looking to build a business or get a better understanding of the business model canvas.
